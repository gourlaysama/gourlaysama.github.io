I'm beginning an attempt at blogging again.

<!--more-->

It's been many years since I last blogged, but I've decided to start again. We'll see where it
goes.

The posts will be mostly technical---some Rust, some Scala, stuff about Fedora and Linux,
who knows what else---but I may blog about other things here and there. If needed I'll add a
dedicated feed for technical posts.
